Intelligent robotics agent within Webots to complete a variety of tasks using AI and ML fundamental technologies

# Project overview
In the first phase, we will be developing a simple robotic agent to navigate a room autonomously solely using computer vision. 
From there, many avenues and opportunities are available to move onto. Specifics will be decided upon once intro project is completed.
