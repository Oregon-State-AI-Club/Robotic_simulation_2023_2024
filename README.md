# Robotic_simulation_2023_2024
Intelligent robotics agent within Webots to complete a variety of tasks using AI and ML fundamental technologies

# Project overview
In the first phase, we will be developing a simple robotic agent to navigate a room autonomously solely using computer vision. 
From there, many avenues and opportunities are available to move onto. Specifics will be decided upon once intro project is completed.

# Task descriptions
Autonomous navigation, especially in clustered spaces, are common robotics problems. Due to their variance, difficulty, and nuance, AI solutions are a common approach for many applications.
## Task _0
While drab, Linus's apartment is very lively! Filled with very valuable furniture and Linus's furry friends, he has bought this robot to provide security to his room! 
Navigate around and through Linus's room without getting stuck. 
### No optimal goals. This is to provide a sandbox for a multitude of obstalces, but you can make any challenge you want!
For all the below tasks, the main goal is to navigate from one side of the arena to the other with constricted bounds and relatively increasing difficulty in obstacles. 
## Task_1
Linus is a cynical owner. After putting a hole into his apartment wall, he has confined you ot the kitchen table until you have proven yourself worthy!
## Task_2
Linus still has you caged in, but has guests coming over! Chairs now hang off the ends of the table, and while you still are able to navigate under, provide additional challenge computationally.
## Task_3
Linus's dog, Tux, knocked over one of the chairs and is now blocking a large portion of one side of the table! Oh, he also blamed it on you.
## Task_4
In the aftermath of the destruction, Linus has opted to pack away the extra chairs just in case you try anything funny. These big boxes now totally block 2 seperate paths.

While not a competition, there is definitely pride in solving a complex problem the most elegantly. Feel free to record your simulation through webots, and post it to the designated channel in discord!
