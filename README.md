# Robotic_simulation_2023_2024
Intelligent robotics agent within Webots to complete a variety of tasks using AI and ML fundamental technologies

# Project overview
In the first phase, we will be developing a simple robotic agent to navigate a room autonomously solely using computer vision. 
From there, many avenues and opportunities are available to move onto. Specifics will be decided upon once intro project is completed.

# Github Info
For more relevant info/ participating in project development, check out the "Beginning Robot" branch for more information.

# HOW TO USE
All you need to do is locally clone/fork the repo to your local machine.
From there, navigate to the world directory. There should be a single .wbt file located inside
Double clicking that world, assuming you have webots installed, should launch the world and the controller.
